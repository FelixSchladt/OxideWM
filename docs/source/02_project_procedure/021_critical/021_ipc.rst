.. _ipc:

===========================
Inter Process Communication 
===========================

During a first discussion it was decided that *Oxide* should be
controllable via an IPC mechanism. This functionality will be inspired
by i3-msg.

Description
-----------

An IPC mechanism for the window manager is required. This is neccessary
for:

-  Taskbar
-  External libraries
-  Command line utility

Feature list
------------

The following list includes currently proposed features

-  everything that is achievable via the keyboard (kill, move, launch…)
-  current state of the window manager including e.g. layout or windows

IPC integration solution
------------------------

Since there are two types of events that have to be handled, there needs
to be some separation between them.

One type are ``xevents``, received from the ``X11`` instance, and the
other one is custom events created by the user, received over ``zbus``.

For this reason, each type of event will get its own loop on its own
thread, which will await them and push them into a list shared between
them. The events in this list will be taken care of by the window
manager, who will execute the correct action based on event type and
content.

Technical solution
------------------

The following sections describe the argument for the different
IPC-mechanisms and libraries.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As for the aforementioned use cases it will not be required to send
large amounts of data. Only short messages will be exchanged between the
clients. Also it is not expected that the IPC performance will have a
significant impact on the usability of the system. Therefore some IPC
options such as shared memory and semaphores will not be regarded as
these options are not as easy to use and do not offer any significant
advantages.

Possible IPC mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are multiple different ways of implementing IPC on posix systems.

FIFO
^^^^

`Named Pipes Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe>`__ 

- work like normal pipes, but are a permanent file on the system 
- fasted regarded option 
- good library support

Unix Sockets
^^^^^^^^^^^^

`Unix Domain Sockets
Wikipedia <https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_Domain_Socket>`__ 

- work like TCP sockets 
- very fast IPC mechanism 
- easy to use and inbuilt library support

D-Bus
^^^^^

| `D-Bus Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-Bus>`__ 
| `D-Bus documentation Rust <https://docs.rs/dbus/latest/dbus/>`__ 
| `D-Bus create from freedesktop.org <https://dbus.pages.freedesktop.org/zbus/>`__
| `D-Bus interface for Rust <https://github.com/diwic/dbus-rs>`__ 

- high level IPC mechanism 
- based on unix sockets 
- widely used in projects such as Gnome and KDE 
- offers message queing, tow way communication and is supposed to offer a easy to use interface 
- comparetively slow compared to FIFO or UNIX sockets

Key Takeaways
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

| `Discussion about IPC on Stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1235958/ipc-performance-named-pipe-vs-socket>`__
| `Stackoverflow Comparison D-Bus vs Unix Sockets <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33887063/difference-between-dbus-and-other-interprocess-communications-method>`__
| `Practical uses of D-Bus <https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/604258/what-is-d-bus-practically-useful-for>`__

-  TCP Sockets are only about 16% slower compared to FIFO
-  IPC performance is in most cases not the bottleneck
-  Sockets allow for two way communication
-  Sockets are more widely supported
-  IPC interface should be abstracted, so that the IPC mechanism can be
   changed in a later stage
-  D-Bus should offer a high level, simple to use IPC mechanism

Conclusion
~~~~~~~~~~

After a technical discussion with the team the conclusion came to
that **D-Bus is most suitable**. The **performance is deemed non
critical** in our use case and the ease of use will be benefitial for
the project. None the less, the IPC interface should be **created in an
abstract manner** allowing for a possible replacement of the underlying
IPC mechanism.

Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Available libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There seem to be two main projects striving to provide D-Bus support for
rust.

| `Zbus project repository <https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/dbus/zbus/-/tree/main>`__
| `Zbus crate <https://crates.io/crates/zbus>`__
| `Zbus documentation <https://dbus.pages.freedesktop.org/zbus/>`__ 

- official D-Bus rust implementation by the freedesktop.org foundation 
- pure rust implementation 
- extensive documentation 
- examples

| `dbus-rs repository <https://github.com/diwic/dbus-rs>`__ 
| `dbus crate <https://crates.io/crates/dbus>`__ 

- wrapper library for libdbus -> libdbus dependency - examples

.. _conclusion-1:

Conclusion
^^^^^^^^^^

Zbus seems to have some advantages over D-Bus-rs, mainly: - official
freedesktop.org library - pure rust -> no libdbus dependency -
Extensive documentation - Due to being an official library, maintenance
is most likely certain

Therefore we came to the conclusion **to use zbus** as our IPC library.

.. _conclusion-2:

Conclusion
----------

As IPC-mechanism **dbus** was chosen as most suitable. The rust library
**zbus** has been chosen as implementation.
