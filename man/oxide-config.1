.SH NAME
.PP
oxide-config - config of Oxide
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Define the behavior of Oxide.
The config file provides the possibility to customize e.
g.
keybindings, layout, style.
If the home config file is not existing, default values will be used but
commands like \f[V]exec\f[R] and \f[V]exec_always\f[R] will not be
working.
The config file is written in YAML.
.SH FILES
.PP
During launch, Oxide searches for a config file in the following
locations:
.TP
\f[B]\[ti]/.config/oxide/config.yml\f[R]
home config file
.TP
\f[B]/etc/oxide/config.yml\f[R]
system config file
.SH KEYBINDING
.SS KEYS
.PP
A keybinding has to consist of at least one or more MODIFIERS and
exactly one normal key such as `t' for example.
.SS MODIFIER
.TP
\f[B]M\f[R]
Meta key
.TP
\f[B]A\f[R]
ALT key
.TP
\f[B]C\f[R]
CONTROL key
.TP
\f[B]S\f[R]
SHIFT key
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
Commands consist of a command and optional arguments.
.SS COMMAND
.TP

move window
.TP
Focus \f[B]args\f[R] MOVEMENT
move focus
.TP
Quit
quit the window manager
.TP
Kill
kill the currently focused window
.TP
Restart
reloads the config and restarts components
.TP
Layout \f[B]args\f[R] LAYOUT
change the current layout
.TP
GoToWorkspace \f[B]args\f[R] WORKSPACE_ARGS
change the current workspace
.TP
MoveToWorkspace \f[B]args\f[R] WORKSPACE_ARGS
move the used window to a different workspace
.TP
MoveToWorkspaceAndFollow \f[B]args\f[R] WORKSPACE_ARGS
move the focused window to and select a different workspace
.TP
Exec \f[B]args\f[R] COMMAND
execute a given command
.TP
Fullscreen
toggle fullscreen mode for the focused window
.SS ARGS
.PP
Command arguments are necessary for the movement, the layout or to
control workspaces.
.SS MOVEMENT
.TP
Left
moves to the left
.TP
Right
moves to the right
.SS LAYOUT
.TP
VerticalStriped
windows vertically next to each other
.TP
HorizontalStriped
windows horizontally underneath each other
.TP
None
if no argument is provided, the next layout is chosen
.SS WORKSPACE_ARGS
.TP
Next
next initialized workspace with a higher index than the current
workspace
.TP
Previous
next initialized workspace with a lower index than the current workspace
.TP
Next_free
next available workspace with a higher index than the current workspace
which is not initialized
.TP
Index
workspace with the given index
.SH ITERATIONS
.PP
The iteration commands provide the possibility to change between
workspaces when given an iteration number as shown in the example down
below.
.TP
iter
iterates over given number in order to change
.SH DEFAULT KEYBINDINGS
.PP
Here is a short overview of the default keybindings.
.TP
Meta+Shift+e
quits the window manager
.TP
Meta+Shift+r
restarts the window manager
.TP
Meta+Shift+q
kills the current window
.TP
h/l
direction keys (left/right)
.TP
Meta+[DIRECTION]
changes the focus to the direction window
.TP
Meta+Shift+[DIRECTION]
moves the window to the direction
.TP
Meta+f
changes the current window to fullscreen
.TP
Meta+u
switches to the next layout
.TP
Meta+i
changes the layout to vertical
.TP
Meta+Shift+i
changes to layout to horizontal
.TP
Right/Left
workspace navigation keys (next/previous)
.TP
Meta+[WORKSPACE_DIRECTION]
changes to the workspace direction
.TP
Meta+n
opens a new workspace
.TP
Control+Meta+[WORKSPACE_DIRECTION]
moves a window to the workspace direction
.TP
Control+Meta+n
opens a new workspace and moves the window to it
.TP
Meta+Shift+[WORKSPACE_DIRECTION]
moves the window to the workspace direction and follows it
.TP
Meta+Shift+n
creates a new workspace, moves the window to it and follows
.TP
Control+Meta+Down
quits the workspace
.TP
Meta+t
opens dmenu
.TP
1/2/3/4/5/6/7/8/9
workspace numbers
.TP
Meta+[WORKSPACE_NUMBER]
switches to workspace number
.TP
Control+Meta+[WORKSPACE_NUMBER]
moves window to workspace number
.TP
Meta+Shift+[WORKSPACE_NUMBER]
moves window to workspace number and follows it
.SH BORDERS
.TP
border_width
sets the border width of windows in pixels
.TP
border_color
sets the border color and has to be entered in hexadecimal
.TP
border_focus_color
sets the border color for focused windows and has to be entered in
hexadecimal
.TP
gap
gap between windows in pixels
.SH EXECUTE
.TP
exec
one time execution when the window manager starts
.TP
exec_always
is executed during start of the window manager and also at each restart
.SH EXAMPLES
.SS KEYBINDINGS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
cmds:
  - keys: [\[dq]M\[dq], \[dq]t\[dq]]
    commands:
      - command: Exec
        args: \[dq]dmenu\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In this example pressing the meta key and `t', a new dmenu window is
opened.
.SS ITERATIONS
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
iter_cmds:
  - iter: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    command:
      keys: [\[dq]M\[dq], \[dq]C\[dq], \[dq]$VAR\[dq]]
      commands:
        - command: GoToWorkspace
          args: \[dq]$VAR\[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
In this example using the ALT and CONTROL key paired with a number from
one to nine, the user can go to the desired workspace.
\f[V]$VAR\f[R] is a reference for the entered iterator.
